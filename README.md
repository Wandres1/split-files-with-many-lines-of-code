# Hi
In this repository you will find a very simple code, which will help you to divide millions of lines of code into files with less than these lines of code.

## Example:

I made this code because I needed to split a file with 873519 lines of code to optimize it and make it easier to run against the database. (in this case I divided it into 100,000 lines of code per file)

The only drawback is that you have to remove the double quotes " "

note: I can't upload the original file because it's too big, but in the "examples" folder are the first 2 files of the 8 files.
